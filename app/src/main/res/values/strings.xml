    <string name="kohli">Virat Kohli</string>
    <string name="kohli_desc">Virat Kohli born 5 November 1988 is an Indian international cricketer who currently
        captains the India national team. A right-handed top-order batsman, Kohli is regarded as one of the best batsmen
        in the world.[3] He plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL), and has been the
        team\'s captain since 2013. Born and raised in Delhi, Kohli represented the city\'s cricket team at various
        age-group levels before making his first-class debut in 2006. He captained India Under-19s to victory at the
        2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia, and a few months later, made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at
        the age of 19. Initially having played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a
        regular in the ODI middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup. He made his Test debut in
        2011 and shrugged off the tag of \"ODI specialist\" by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South Africa.[4]
        Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time in 2013,[5] Kohli also
        found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2014
        and 2016). In 2014, he became the top-ranked T20I batsman in the ICC rankings, holding the position for three
        successive years until 2017. Since October 2017, he has been the top-ranked ODI batsman in the world and is
        currently the leading batsman in the Test rankings.[6] Among Indian batsmen, Kohli has the best ever Test rating
        (937 points), ODI rating (911 points) and T20I rating (897 points).

        be pegged by many analysts as a permanent fixture in the Indian cricket team in the next decade. He made his ODI
        debut on 23 June 2007 against Ireland. In 2013, he started playing as an opening batsman for India ODI team and
        performed consistently. He scored consecutive centuries in his first two Test matches against the West Indies in
        November 2013, scoring 177 at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on debut, followed by a score of 111* in the next Test
