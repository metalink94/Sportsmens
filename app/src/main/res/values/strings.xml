    <string name="detail_descr_1">Sevilla and Celta Vigo take on each other at Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan in what is
        expected to be one of the most exciting games of the weekend. Los Sevillanos aim to keep their 100% record in
        the 2019/2020 season intact and you should bear in mind that they are eyeing their third consecutive clean sheet
        in the national championship. Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan will be packed on Friday evening as Sevilla take on
        Celta in their first home game of the season.\n\n Seeing that los Sevillanos are a real force to be reckoned with at
        home, we predict that they are going to give fans yet another reason for celebration. Os Celeste quickly bounced
        back from a 3-1 loss to Real Madrid, with the team beating Valencia 1-0 in front of home fans at the weekend.
        However, seeing that their away record in La Liga is anything but good, home win should be considered.

    <string name="detail_descr_2">There will be fireworks when Athletic Club and Real Sociedad face each other in the
        Basque derby at San Mames Barria on Friday evening. Following a hard-fought 1-0 win over title holders
        Barcelona, the Lions shared the spoils with Getafe in the suburbs of Madrid at the weekend. Coaching duo
        Garitano – Etxeberria can count on key players for Friday’s local derby and seeing that Athletic Club have
        turned their stadium into a real fortress, we predict that they are going to return to winning ways on Matchday
        3.\n\n La Real, on the other hand, did well to beat newcomers Mallorca 1-0 at Iberostar Estadi on day 2, with
        Norwegian rising star Martin Odegaard scoring the only goal of the match. However, Real Sociedad will have a
        much bigger fish to fry against Athletic Club, who are a real force to be reckoned with at home.

    <string name="detail_descr_3">Bologna and SPAL face each other at Stadio Renato Dall’Ara on day 2 of the new Serie A
        campaign. The Rossoblu played out a 1-1 draw with Verona in the “City of Love” in their opener, with the match
        being marked by Sinisa Mihajlovic’s return. The Serbian coach is still recovering from an acute leukemia, but he
        obviously wants to help his team by being present on every single match.\n\n Bologna fans are likely to pack Stadio
        Renato Dall’Ara on Friday evening and seeing that SPAL experienced all sorts of problems at the back in a 3-2
        loss to Atalanta in the opening match of the season, we believe that there is a big value in betting on Sinisa
        Mihajlovic’s charges. In their last meeting in Bologna in the national championship SPAL emerged triumphant,
        meaning that the hosts are hungry for revenge.

    <string name="detail_descr_4">Borussia M’gladbach and Leipzig face each other at Stadion im Borussia-Park in what is
        expected to be one of the most entertaining games of the weekend. Borussia M’gladbach aim to build on a 3-1 win
        over Mainz and we predict that they are going to adopt an attack-minded approach against Leipzig. We are
        positive that die Fohlen are going to find the net in the Stadion im Borussia-Park clash and given Leipzig’s
        attacking potential, we believe that there is a big value in betting on both teams to score.\n\n The Red Bulls, on
        the other hand, head into the match following back-to-back wins over Union Berlin and Eintracht Frankfurt and
        they are definitely capable of finding the net against die Fohlen. In their last meeting in the national
        championship Leipzig recorded a 2-1 win over Borussia M’gladbach and yet another high-scoring affair is on the
        cards.
